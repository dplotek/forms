# Forms built with React.js, Styled Components and React Hook Form

While I was learning vanilla js, I found a Facebook group that created a weekly challenge of recreating the page in HTML, CSS and vanilla js. I liked this project so much that I decided to recreate it in React by adding a few features:

* Registration - you can create your account, owe to React Hook Form registration will be successful only when the validator checks the correctness of all fields of the form. The data is stored in the global state using the Context Provider, due to the GDPR, the website does not store your data and after refreshing the page, your data disappears.
* E-mail message - due to the GDPR, the functionality of this component is limited to custom validation and clearing all fields after sending the message correctly
* Logging in - after registering your account, you can log in to it and check your data.
* Password reminder - if you forget your password, you can check it by entering your e-mail address.
* Newsletter - it will not send you spam, it will not send you anything, but it may disappear.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
